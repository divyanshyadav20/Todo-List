# Todo-List

This is a Todo List application which consists of four primary features: 

1. A separate lists section where the user can store different kinds of list, each having their own set of tasks.
2. The tasks completed can be checked and unchecked according to their completion. The completed tasks can also be cleared on the click of a button.
3. Lists and tasks created by the user can be stored in the local storage of the user's browser to avoid losing the data on refresing the webpage.
4. This application is mobile responsive as well.
